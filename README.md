January 2025 I came up with [a space version of pencil and paper game](https://geoffburns.github.io/HiddenBattle/docs/gamesheets/SpaceAndAsteroid/index.html). I play tested it with my children and it went fairly well.

I will give the game sheets another round of polish before doing a blog post about them in November.

I have been slowly adding the rules for [the space version](https://geoffburns.github.io/HiddenBattle/docs/gamesheets/SpaceAndAsteroid/index.html) into the javascript game. The JS version should support the space version by December
